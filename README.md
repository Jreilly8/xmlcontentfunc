# xmlcontentfunc
Data handler for dynamic content via xml. Loops though .xml where the domain data is stored, and makes it available for use. It matches the site url to the url tag in the xml file, and makes that set of tags available to update the page with. Potential use: add symbolic link to one index file in multiple web roots.
